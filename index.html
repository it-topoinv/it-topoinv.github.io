<h3>Our Do Not Track Policy</h3>
<p>Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals. Third-parties, such as our analytics providers (such as those of Google Analytics), may collect data that relates to you on our Site. We cannot control third-parties’ responses to Do Not Track signals. Third-parties’ responsiveness to Do Not Track signals is governed by their respective privacy policies. Please note that we do not change our practices in response to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from a browser or mobile application.</p>
<h3>Specific Rights in Certain Jurisdictions</h3>
<p>If you live in the EU, the UK, California, or jurisdictions with similar laws, you may have additional rights, depending on your relationship with us. These rights may include (subject to certain limitations) to confirm that Topo is processing your personal information, to access the personal information we keep about you, to restrict or object to the processing of your personal information, or to rectify, erase, and port your personal information. Those rights are:</p>
<p>Access and Portability: You have the right to obtain confirmation that we process your personal information and access to the personal information we have about you. In response to a verified request, we will provide:</p>
<p>(1) the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;</p>
<p>(2) the categories of sources from which the personal information about you was collected;</p>
<p>(3) the business or commercial purpose for which we collect or sell your personal information;</p>
<p>(4) the categories of third parties with whom we share your personal information; and</p>
<p>(5) the categories of personal information that we disclosed about you for a business or commercial purpose. EU and UK residents can ask us to move their information to a third party.</p>
<p><i>Rectification</i>: You have the right to have inaccurate personal information rectified.</p>
<p><i>Erasure</i>: You have the right to request that we delete your personal information. Please note that in certain instances we may not be able to process your request, such as (i) due to the existence of a legal obligation, (ii) to detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities, or (iii) in order to complete a transaction for which your personal information was collected.</p>
<p><i>Restrict or Object to Processing</i>: UK and EU residents, as an alternative to requesting the erasure of your personal information, you have the right to limit the way we use your personal information in certain circumstances. In some cases you also have the right to object to how we process information.</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>To exercise your rights submit your request here, or you can contact us as follows: DSR@topoinv.com. For verification purposes, we may request your first and last name, email address or physical address you may have used when interacting with us. We may also ask for a copy of your government-issued ID.</p>
<p>If you are submitting on someone else’s behalf we may ask for additional verification. This may include providing a signed letter verifying your right to make this request.</p>
<p>We will not discriminate against you because you exercised your rights under the CCPA. Please keep in mind that these rights are not absolute. In some situations we may not be able to process your request. This may include if a legal exception applies. We’ll let you know when or if a right doesn’t apply to you. If you disagree with our decision you can contact us as described at the end of this statement.</p>
<h3>Nevada Residents</h3>
<p>You may opt out of the future sale of your information to a third party so that they may license or sell that information. To do this email us at the contact information listed at the end of this privacy statement.</p>
<h3>Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing</h3>
<p>Under California law, we are required to tell you if we "sell" information including information of Californians under 16. We do not believe we are engaging in selling as that term is defined under that law. We do not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age. Some browsers or browser extensions allow you to tell websites not to share your information for cross-contextual behavioral advertising. While we do not currently engage in that activity, if we do we will respond to this signal in a frictionless manner. You may also visit optout.aboutads.info to control cookies collected for behavioral advertising, however we do not currently engage in this practice.</p>
<h3>What About Children?</h3>
<p>Our sites are meant for adults. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child under 13 has given us information, you can contact us at the email above. Please mark your inquiries “COPPA Information Request.”</p>
<h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
<p>Should you wish to make an inquiry or complaint about Topo’ use of your personal information, you may contact Topo as set out below.</p>
<p>EU and UK residents, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate regulatory body/supervisory authority, in particular in the country where you reside, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the law. The UK supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). You can visit their website at www.ico.org.uk.
